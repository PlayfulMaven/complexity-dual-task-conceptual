# complexity-dual-task-conceptual
This repo contains a Jupyter notebook with Python code that will produce 3 .png files of conceptual models for motor-cognitive solutions in embodied and continuous decision-making paradigms. The final versions of the figures have also been included for clarity.

# Main Conceptual Graphic
The image below details a conceptual representation of the interactions between cognitive and motor aspects of performance in embodied and continuous decision-making paradigms.

# High vs Low Skill Graphic
The image below details a conceptual representation of higher and lower skilled individuals and their respective interactions between cognitive and motor aspects of performance in embodied and continuous decision-making paradigms. **Note**: Higher skilled individuals have more potential motor-cognitive solutions camparitavely, however, lower skilled individuals have a vast number of potential motor-cognitive solutions within their solution space.
